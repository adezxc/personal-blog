Hi, my name's Adam. I am interested in all things technology,
open source software and coffee, and this is a place where maybe
I'll get to writing something about the experiences with those things.

I have a Bachelor's in Bioinformatics @ Vilnius University. 

Previously SRE @ Unity, Go dev @ VMware (working on [vCloud Director Terraform provider](https://github.com/vmware/terraform-provider-vcd))

Currently an SRE @ SEB, with a focus on Data engineering.
